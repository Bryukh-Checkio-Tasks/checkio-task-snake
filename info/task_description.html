    We all know about the classic game
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game)">"Snake"</a>.

</p>
<p>
    You are given a 10x10 field of cells. You control a snake and your task is to eat 5 cherries which are randomly
    placed on the field. The snake starts the game 5 units long and grows by one unit for each cherry it eats. In order
    to survive long enough to eat the cherries, the snake must not hit a tree, the edge of the field, or its own body.
    To do so would trigger a game over. The snake does not sit still and is constantly moving. It can go in one of 3
    directions: Forward “F”, Left “L” and Right “R”. Left and right are defined by the current position and trajectory
    of the snakes head. The map of field is presented as list of strings, where:
</p>
<pre>
    "." - Empty cell
    "T" - Tree
    "C" - Cherry
    "0" - Snake head
    "1..9" -  Numbered Segments of the Snake Body
</pre>
<p>
    This is a multi-call task and your function will be called repeatedly until the game is complete. During each
    function call, you can return a character or a string that contains a sequence of actions (example: “FRFLF.”) Once
    the snake eats a cherry the remaining actions are dropped, a new cherry appears and the game continues. Once 5
    cherries are eaten the game is over and you win. This version of snake has an interesting twist: you must eat the 5
    cherries in 250 steps or less or face a game over.

    <strong>Hints: </strong><br>
    Be careful if you use breadth first search -- it can take a long time if you select a bad state representation.<br>
    At first the snake will move its tail then it will move its head. You can try to chase the tail this way.<br>
    New cherries can't appear in the outer cells (ex. [0,0], [9, 9]).
